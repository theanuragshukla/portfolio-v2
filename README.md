# Personal Portfolio-v2
This is my second attempt at building my personal portfolio website. The first one is deployed [here](https://theanuragshukla.github.io/portfolio). 

## Problems with old portfolio
- built in 2021
- coded it on a phone
- some features break on modern browsers
- not a lot of space
- static spa

## Features of new portfolio
- Well organized code
- dockerized
- built-in blog & CMS for writing new ones
- Dynamically updated via git hooks
- lots of space to add things, while keeping the UI clean

## Deployment
- Github pages: [https://theanuragshukla.github.io/portfolio-v2](https://theanuragshukla.github.io/portfolio-v2)
- [https://anurags.tech](https://anurags.tech)
